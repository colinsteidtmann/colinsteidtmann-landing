						Having gone to bed so late last night, I slept in until 7 am. It was great to sleep on a futon in a sheltered place instead of camping like I did the night before. I packed my gear and made some oatmeal and fruit for breakfast. Before leaving the warmshowers cottage, I said goodbye and got a photo with my warmshowers host, Joan.

						Joan wished me farewell, had me sign her guestbook before I left, and asked me to send postcards back to her as I made my way through America. She also told me about the MIT and Stanford “Spokes” kids who stayed at her cottage before. They’re groups of college students who spend the summer biking across America (with a van supporting them), teaching STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) to people in the towns they ride through. I thought that was pretty cool, thinking maybe someday I could ride with the MIT spokes group and see Joan again. Anyhow, I left Carson City on a sunny morning with the plan to do a short ride to Fallon Nevada where I had another Warmshowers lined up. The ride started out flat as I got onto highway 50. I climbed one little hill and then started a long, very slight, and almost flat descent. I passed many miles of strip malls before getting to the open desert. Once in the open desert, there was one big downhill that took me through an old mining town and then things remained pretty flat until Fallon.

						I was riding through the open desert on highway 50. I had a nice shoulder to ride on and new pavement. It was flat and I was having a good time. I passed one reservoir which didn’t look too healthy and surprised me because it was a lake in the desert. By about 12:30 in the afternoon, I had reached Fallon.

						Fallon is a pretty big town. They have all the chain stores (Walmart, Safeway, fast-food chains, big brands), and a good number of people. It’s supposedly the last big town for a while if you’re driving across Nevada on highway 50. Once in Fallon, I went to a park to eat some lunch (almond butter sandwich). I called my mom, then my Warmshowers host, and planned on riding to their house after I ate.

						It was hot in Fallon but not unbearable, mid 80s or so. After lunch, I rode to my Warmshowers host’s house. They lived only a couple miles away from the city center. They had a big ranch style home by a river. I got to their home before Stacy (the host) got there because she was coming during a break from work.

						Stacy works at a school. Her husband Brad was in bed, not able to move much because he had just gotten surgery. Stacy showed me around, told me to make myself at home, and then she had to go back to work. I got my things set up in their house, took a shower, took a nap, and looked at my phone. At around 4:30, I left their house to go to Walmart and Walgreens. I restocked on food and bought a bike lock.

						When I returned at around 6:00 pm or so, Stacy was back. I ran my laundry, gave old bread to their chickens, and hung out until Stacy’s dinner was cooked.

						Stacy made some delicious chicken, cheesy potatoes, a salad, and really good pickled veggies. Stacy and I ate dinner together and had good conversations about Stacy’s life and why she did Warmshowers. Although Stacy and Brad don’t do much bicycling, they like bicycle tourists, like to hear their stories and help them out by hosting them. Brad and Stacy said they’ve been doing it for years, off and on depending on Brad’s health, and they told me I was their first guest for the year. They said that usually they have tons of guests by now (mid-July), but because of Covid-19 there’s been almost no bicycle tourists. This was a bummer for me to hear, I was really hoping to see other bicycle tourists on the road because that would motivate and inspire me to keep going. Anyhow, as I looked at the day ahead, it looked tough. A hundred miles or so through the Nevada desert until the next little town, Austin, and with only one place to stop and refill water bottles in between. So, after dinner that night, I went to bed with the plan to wake up super early and leave by sunrise. It was a good recovery day and I got well rested for the journey ahead.
