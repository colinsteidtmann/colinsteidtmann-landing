						The birds woke me up at 4:30 in the morning. I was ready to wake up anyways, trying to get out of my stealth camping spot before anyone noticed me. I packed things up and got breakfast going. Oatmeal and tea, it was a nice sunny morning but I felt pretty grimy because I slept in my sweaty clothes and wasn’t able to wash up and such.

						After breakfast, I put on my sunglasses and began riding on the Carson Pass Highway, the only road for the rest of the day. So began a long day of gradual climbing through the Sierra Nevada forestry. There wasn’t much of a shoulder and there was a decent amount of car traffic but thankfully the road wasn’t too steep. After the first 15 miles or so I stopped at an IGA grocery store, my first one ever, to refill my water bottles.

						Musical cows?
					</Article.Subheader>

						One interesting thing I passed by were some cows grazing but they had bells on them so that when they ate grass, the 50 or so cows would make music in the fields. That was neat. Other than that, I was riding in the forest, saw a couple interesting rocks, and I tried to listen to an audible but I kept losing focus. A few hours later I passed my first lake!

						That was pretty nice to see. As I kept climbing up the mountain, I saw some big views too and got a couple of photos while I took a break.

						Slow going
					</Article.Subheader>

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I was probably averaging about 8 mph so things were pretty slow moving. But, you know, you think about things and you see the ground moving under you which makes you feel that you're making progress, so eventually I reached the top of one mountain and I had my first big downhill. I descended into Kirkwood, a ski resort town, and I rode right past it (I would’ve had to go a few miles off route if I wanted to see anything). It’s always a bummer when you go down a mountain while trying to get through some mountain ranges (what goes down must go up). After Kirkwood, I descended some more and came across another beautiful lake.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						Then began the expected and dreaded climb back up another Sierra Nevada mountain. It was only 800 feet or so until the next mountain peak, I passed by some road construction. Then I went down another short hill. When things flattened out, I saw my first bicycle tourist on my trip. He was going the same way I was going, just a little slower. I rode up next to him and we started talking. Since we were on a highway he asked that we just pull over. He was an older guy, retired, and has been living off his bike for the past 3 years. He said he’s been riding all around Western America, camping a few nights, biking a little here and there, just living life on his bike. He was an interesting guy and I was happy to see another bicyclist finally, but since he wasn’t doing what I was doing, we had to say our goodbyes and I rode ahead.

						I finally reached the mountain peak at about 2 pm. My plan for the day was to ride to Carson City and go through Lake Tahoe. However, this would have been 60 more miles and I had only gone about 50 miles the entire day. So, I opted instead to just stay on the Carson Pass Highway which skipped by Lake Tahoe and went straight to Carson City. Lake Tahoe is a beautiful place, that’s why they put it on my cycling map, but, I’ve been there many times before and I didn’t feel that doing all the extra miles and time was essential for me. After I reached the summit, the longest descent of my life began. I descended downhill for 20 miles before stopping by a nice looking river to eat some lunch. Other people, in cars, were stopped there too. Either to fish or just to enjoy the river.

						I then continued down the mountain, dropping elevation rapidly, seeing the geography change from forest to desert. It was another 15 miles and 2,000 feet before I finally reached flat land. Gone were the trees, now there were low bushes and some grass, also, the Nevada border sign!

						It was 24 more miles of flat ground riding until Carson City. It took me about 2 hours, I passed by mostly farms and faced some cross winds. When I got to Carson city at 6pm, I went straight to a bike shop before they closed so that I could get some “chamois butter” (lotion you rub around your butt and legs so that way your skin doesn’t chafe from friction between your shorts and bike seat). The skin on my legs and butt were burning from being broken down by friction between my bike seat and shorts, so I bought some cream (very common in cycling) to hopefully reduce the friction.

						After that, I sat on a bench in Carson City to figure out where I was going to stay. I had called all the warmshowers hosts there were but either they couldn’t host (because of Covid) or they weren’t responding to me. Since there were no RV parks or campsites in Carson City, and it was getting late, at about 8pm I made a cheap hotel reservation with my mom’s permission. Before going to the hotel I went to a Grocery Outlet to pick up some avocados, rice, yogurt, and bananas.

						I then rode to the hotel and tried to get my room. However, when the lady at the desk asked for some ID, I had to tell her I had none. I don’t have a driver's license or state id card, and I’m 17. I tried to give her my school ID but she said that wouldn’t work. I begged and pleaded but she said “no ID, no room.” It was 8:30pm, getting dark, I didn’t know what to do. I pushed my bike out of the hotel lobby and sat on their sidewalk wondering what to do. I seriously questioned myself on what I was doing and how I was going to complete this bike trip. While I was eating some bananas, I thankfully got a lifesaving phone call from one of the Warmshowers hosts in Carson City. They would be able to host me that night! I was so thankful and happy, they were only a 10 minute ride from the hotel. I rode over to their house, Joan and Greg Wright greeted me in front, allowed me to put my bike in their garage, and then they showed me the little cabin I would be staying in. It was a separate cottage from their house but still on their property. It had its own kitchen, shower, bathroom, futon, and dining room table. I couldn’t ask for more. I said my many thanks to Joan, took a shower, cooked dinner (rice, avocados, and yogurt), and looked at my phone. The cottage also had some delicious chocolate tea from the last guest who must have left it, so I sipped on that and relaxed in peace before going to bed at 11 or so. Overall, it was a long and exhausting day, but now I was in a new state and was beginning a new journey. I felt like I was starting to get a long way from home now and going back wasn’t going to be an option. I saw some beautiful sights in the Sierra Nevadas and I felt I was truly saved by myWwarmshowers hosts Joan and Greg. I was happy to be out of the mountains and looked forward to the Nevada flats, but the desert heat worried me as I went to bed.
