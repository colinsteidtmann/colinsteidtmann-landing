						Let's get going!
					</Article.Subheader>

					<Article.Bodytext>
						It was still dark out when I woke up in the Austin motel to start getting ready. The plan for the day was to ride a relatively short 65 miles or so to Eureka Nevada. I went out to the hotel BBQ and fired it up for some eggs, oatmeal, and tea. I looked at my phone a bit and checked out the route, knowing I wouldn’t have cell service or wifi again until Eureka. By 6 am, the sun was beginning to rise so I got started.

						The ride began with a decent sized climb up and out of Austin. I had plenty of energy though and was riding in the shade so it wasn’t much trouble. I even had time to set up my camera for a third-person view riding picture:

						Once I got up and over the first little mountain, I descended into a surprisingly semi-green and well-forested area. It was very interesting to go from riding in a desert on one side of the mountain, to riding into a grassy, short treed area on the other side.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						However, quickly after I descended down the mountain, I was back in the normal Nevada desert. It was flat, arid, and extremely open. No major mountain for at least 50 miles, just one long stretch of highway that disappeared into the desert horizon. Time to try and occupy myself. Like usual, I tried to listen to podcasts, and that worked for an hour or two but then I got annoyed with the repetitive nature of them so I turned them off. So, I went back to thinking about nothing, just taking it one mile at a time. To take a short break, I set my camera up again to get another 3rd person view photo:

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I did see some interesting things in the desert. I saw a few snakes, a jackrabbit, antelopes, and there were oddly tons of beetles all over the highway. There were literally groups of beetles scattered everywhere throughout a 20-mile section of the ride. A lot were squished, a lot were mating and alive, and a few even jumped on my legs. It was weird, must have been a migration, mating, or weather thing. Anyhow, I was making progress towards Eureka. It must have been a little downhill because I was flying. I also did eventually start up the podcasts again, finding a good couple of NPR Planet Money episodes. By 11 am, I had reached Eureka!

						It's pretty early
					</Article.Subheader>

					<Article.Bodytext>
						Eureka was another mining town. There was a big slab of rock ore on the side of the road while I rode in. I first went to a gas station to fill up my water bottles and then I sat on a bench to plan what I was going to do. Originally, the plan was to stay at a motel in Eureka. However, I had gotten there so early that I called my mom and told her I wanted to ride another 80 miles to Ely. So, I went to the hotel where I had a reservation and I asked them to please cancel it. Then, I found a nice table in the shade to have some lunch. While I was eating my peanut butter sandwich, a lady came out and started talking to me. It turned out that she was the head of tourism for Eureka and wanted to do a little bit of an interview with me.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						She asked me about my trip, why I was riding, etc. Her husband came out too and told me about the “tall bikes” he builds. People in town apparently call him “tall-bike Ed.” After our little interview, she told me I ought to be on Facebook writing blogs. So, I told her I would make a Facebook later that evening and maybe write a little something. Before leaving, she gave some water bottles for the road ahead.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I left Eureka at about 12 and started the trek to Ely. Little did I know that this would be one of the hardest rides yet and I probably should have stayed in Eureka. Right from the get-go I was riding uphill and into a headwind. Luckily the hill didn’t last long but the headwind persisted. Coming into Eureka, I was averaging 18 mph or so. Now, I was averaging 12 mph. It was going to be a longer ride then I had anticipated.

						Bad move, edit undo!
					</Article.Subheader>

					<Article.Bodytext>
						It was more flat desert and a lot more hours of riding to do. Pedal by pedal stroke, mile by mile. There were surprisingly lots of little mountain passes that I had to get over and these started to tire me out a lot. In addition, it was windy and the wind only kept getting stronger as it got later into the day.I had no cell service, began to ride as slow as 7 mph, was very tired, and had nearly 50 miles until Ely. By about 4 pm, 4 hours after leaving Eureka, I began to feel quite miserable. My water was running very low, it was hot, and I had so much further to go. There were no towns, houses, and very few cars in that desolate land, so I began to feel quite lonely and somewhat sad or depressed. I made more frequent stops as I got more and more tired. I kept wanting to call my mom but I had no cell service and eventually, my phone shut itself off because of the heat. My body ached, things got sort of blurry, yet I had to keep on riding if I wanted to survive.

						By about 6 pm, I was still 25 miles away and the last 25 miles had taken nearly 3 hours. It began to feel like a matter of survival. I was completely out of the water and extremely physically exhausted. I stopped and tried to stick my empty water bottle out as a signal to cars that I need water, but none of them stopped. After a grueling 15 miles or so, another hour and a half, things finally took a turn and there was a gradual downhill. The gradual downhill turned out to go on for quite some time. I was leaving the arid desert and now riding through a little bit of a grassier land.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I saw big mining operations in the distance that completely clear cut mountains and dramatically changed the landscape. It was interesting but also a little sad. The gradual downhill then started getting a little steeper, and pretty soon, I was coasting to Ely.

						Don't close your eyes!
					</Article.Subheader>

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I stopped in town on a sidewalk to call my mom first. I told her how tired I was and how I needed a place to stay. After calling her, I texted a guy who the lady in Eureka told me to text because he may have been able to host me. Sadly, he was out of town. While I was standing up, leaning over my handlebars, looking at my phone for a motel or something, the weirdest thing started happening. I began to feel extremely nauseous. Next thing I knew, I was feeling extremely drowsy. I told myself I was just going to close my eyes for a second, but without being able to control myself, I just tipped over on my bike and fell flat onto the sidewalk. A minute or so later, I woke up and realized that I had just passed out. By now, some bystanders and cars saw and stopped to come and help me. They helped me sit up and collect myself. Damn, I thought, that was wild. That’s never happened to me. One guy wanted to call the hospital but I begged him not to, knowing that would end my trip. The other guy said he worked at a nearby motel and recommended that I stay there. At this point, I was up for anything. So, I slowly walked to the motel while the nice bystander guy walked my bike for me. I was still feeling very sick and weak, I had to sit down and I asked the hotel desk person for some water. After some troubles getting into the motel room (because of my age), I was finally able to get in. It was probably the crummiest motel I had stayed at on the entire trip (stains on the walls, bedding, and in the bathroom, smelled of cigarettes), but I was happy I was alive and had somewhere to sleep. Knowing that I was extremely dehydrated and hungry, I tried to find water and food. But first, I had to call my mom and let her know what had happened. She was worried of course, and told me that if I went to a hospital then my trip would be over. By 8:45 or so, I managed to gain enough strength to walk to a grocery store. First I went to the Dollar General to get plastic containers for microwaving eggs in, and then I went to a supermarket to get eggs, avocados, rice, and bananas.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						Walking to the grocery store took about 20 mins each way, so, by the time I got back to the motel, some thunderclouds had formed and it (surprisingly) began to rain in the Nevada desert. Back in the hotel room, I made eggs in the microwave for the first time and I cooked up the rice, and added in the avocado.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I looked at my phone, created a facebook account, called my mom again, and was off to bed by about 10:45 pm. It was an exhausting day so I didn’t set my alarm for the morning. Hopefully, tomorrow will be shorter.
