					<Article.Bodytext>
						Oof, after yesterday’s crazy adventure I did not have the energy to wake up early. Besides, I wasn’t planning on riding very far today. I woke up at 6:30 am and my goal was to leave by 7. For breakfast, it was microwaved eggs, oatmeal, and topped with an avocado. Microwaving eggs is my new thing.

						I ended up leaving the White Pine Motel at 7:30 am. I have to admit, the White Pine Motel wasn’t too nice (stained bed, walls, bathroom and smelled of cigarette smoke). I was glad to get out of there. I would’ve stayed somewhere a little better if I had planned ahead, but, you know, I was in a pinch yesterday and I trusted the motel worker who helped me get off the sidewalk when I passed out. Anyhow, the ride today was about 62 miles to Baker, Nevada. I thought I would get there by noon.

						Leaving Ely, it was a flat ride into the desert fields. I was taking it easy, a bit scared of overdoing it after yesterday. Early on, I passed a rare sighting of a lake or water storage of some sort.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						Water was a rare sighting in the Nevada desert. The ride was flat and straight for a long way and then I started to climb up the first little mountain. One interesting sighting was a massive prison to my right. It looked pretty scary. As I started climbing the hill, I noticed lots of road signs with snow and chain warnings. I guess that explains where the water I saw came from — it must snow here! You’d never think that if you came during the summer.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						The climb took me into Humboldt National Forest, it wasn’t too bad. While going down the other side, I saw these crazy rocks that I just had to stop and get a picture of. They were dark, shinyish, and broke into little slates. I liked them.

						Moving towards Baker, I rode through the vast and straight road desert.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I saw all these dirt roads off to my right in the mountains and I thought they must have been mining roads. Sure enough, when I stopped to read a tourism sign, it said that they had a huge gold mining operation going on back in 1877.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						As I continued along the straight flat desert road, I turned a right and started going up the second climb. Damn though, it was getting hot! Thankfully, it was mostly downhill from there all the way to Baker.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						When I got to Baker, I tried contacting somebody, who I heard from a person in Ely, that they might be able to host me for the night. Yet, they never answered my calls or texts. Luckily, it was only 12:00 pm so I had a lot of time to kill and figure out where I was going to stay for the night.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						My first stop was the visitor center. I didn’t know that I was in the Great Basin National Park until I read the sign outside their door. In the visitor center, they had the AC running and there was a friendly lady who I could talk to and ask questions. She said they don’t get many visitors, which makes sense because there wasn’t much to see (hot, dry, desert), but the main animals she mentioned sounded pretty cool — cougars, elk, coyotes, but no bears. I also picked up some postcards because I figured it was a good time to write home and to all the people who hosted me so far.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						Leaving the visitor center, and grabbing a photo in front of the Great Basin sign, it was time for lunch! There was no cell service and not much of a town but there was a little trailer selling some coffee.

						Where will I sleep tonight?
					</Article.Subheader>

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I ended up eating in a park and having a yummy peanut butter sandwich. I then spent the next few hours taking a nap, writing my postcards, calling my mom, and asking her to help me find somewhere to stay because all I had was 3G so I couldn’t do any internet browsing.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						It was about 110°F so I stayed in the shade. There was one campsite in Baker but they were pretty pricey, more expensive than a place a few miles down the road. So, after another few hours of sitting around, it was 5:20 pm and I decided to bike to that place a few miles down the road.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						It was called the “Border Inn.” It was right on the border between Nevada and Utah. It was a gas station that let people park their RVs behind it and they had a patch of dirt which they would let people camp on for $5 a night.

					<Article.Bodytext>
						I kind of regret staying there though. It was crazy windy and there wasn’t any grass which made it hard to stake my tent, just some dirt in the back of a gas station lot. But, they had a bath house and attached to the gas station convenience store there was a mini casino with wifi and a mexican restaurant. That’s where I spent the rest of the night. I got all my stuff charged, had dinner (eggs, rice, avocado), looked at my phone, took a shower, and planned the day ahead. I also grabbed my photo in front of the Nevada-Utah border sign because it was right there and I knew that I wanted to leave early in the morning tomorrow when there wouldn’t be much daylight. When I went to bed that night, the stars were incredible! No light pollution and camping in the desert made for spectacular stargazing. Overall, it was a restful day, but I had a big day planned for tomorrow!
